Hekateros - **ROS** Packages
=============

Here you will find a collection of [ROS](http://ros.org) packages for the Hekateros family of robotic manipulators, including simulations and real-world applications. Hekateros is available in 4DOF and 5DOF configurations, plus an additional degree of freedom in the default [Graboid Gripper](http://www.roadnarrows-store.com/roadnarrows-graboid-series-d.html). 

The open mechanical and electrical interface at the end effector make the arm highly-customizeable.
